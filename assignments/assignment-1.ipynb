    "(Taken from exercise 2.37 in text) DNA can be modeled as a string of characters using the alphabet: `A`, `C`, `G`, and `T`. One form of DNA mutation occurs when a substring of the DNA is reversed during the replication process. Usually, such a reversal occurs between what are termed inverted pairs. For example, if the pattern `TGAA` is later followed by the inverted pattern `AAGT`, it is possible that the slice of DNA delimited by those patterns could be inverted and reattached, since the bonds at each end will be locally the same.\n",

    "\n",
    "Design a program that works as follows. Given an original DNA string as well as the particular pattern that is inverted, locate the leftmost occurrence of that pattern, and the next subsequent occurrence of the inverted pattern. Print the mutated DNA, with the segment between the inverted pair reversed. Test your code on the example above.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is not trivial, but can be done using only string manipulation. Please ask if you need any hints. :-)"
