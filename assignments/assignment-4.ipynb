    "As with the Tic-Tac-Toe game it probably makes sense to do this using classes. A class called `ConnectFour` with a method `play()` for example would make sense as the high level class. Another class would be a `Board` class that contains information about the board. This class could contain the following methods:\n",
    "* \\__str\\__ \n",
    "* full_board(): checks if the board is full\n",
    "* place_piece(piece,column): drops a piece in a column\n",
    "* check_winner(piece): checks if the game has been won by either \"x\" or \"o\"\n",
    "* column_full(column): checks if a column is full\n",
    "* player_move(piece): reads in a player move and updates the board\n",
    "\n",
    "To write the `check_winner()` function, it may be useful to define an additional class `SubBoard` that represents a 4x4 board of pieces. To determine if there is a winner, loop through every 4x4 board and check and see if that sub-board has any 4 connecting pieces. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is UML diagram for this implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![connect four UML](images/connect_four_UML.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to test each function after you write them. Here is a possible implementation of the `SubBoard` class that you can use."
